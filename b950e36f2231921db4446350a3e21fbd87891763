      "message": "menu_items use is wrong here. You are outside any menu. it has no sense outside a menu screen. It will just cut your display rows. You could eventually probe for show_menu before running this code to avoid someone calling it without ending a menu\n\nAlso, you should lock mutex before probing any part of these variables\n\nFinally: we have\n#define MAX_ROWS 32\n\nso, setting it to 32, won\u0027t cause any harm as all cwm users will get the last lines that fit their screen. Some would get a small scroll sadly without your implementation, but not a big deal after all for that simple function",
